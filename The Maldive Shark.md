# The Maldive Shark
<b>By Herman Melville</b>

<i>About the Shark, phlegmatical one, <br>
Pale sot of the Maldive sea, <br>
The sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim, <br>
How alert in attendance be. <br>
From his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel of maw <br>
They have nothing of harm to dread, <br>
But liquidly glide on his ghastly flank <br>
Or before his Gorgonian head; <br>
Or lurk in the port of serrated teeth <br>
In white triple tiers of glittering gates, <br>
And there find a haven when peril’s abroad, <br>
An asylum in jaws of the Fates! <br>
They are friends; and friendly they guide him to prey, <br>
Yet never partake of the treat— <br>
Eyes and brains to the dotard lethargic and dull, <br>
Pale ravener of horrible meat.<i>
